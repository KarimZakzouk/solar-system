## üì¶ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KarimZakzouk/solar-system.git
   cd solar-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Dockerized Development

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t solar-system .
   ```

2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 solar-system
   ```

   Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deployment with Terraform & Kubernetes

1. Initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   This will provision the necessary infrastructure.

3. Deploy the application to Kubernetes:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

   Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is set up and configured correctly.
